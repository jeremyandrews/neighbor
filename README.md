Won't you be my neighbor?

## About

Neighbor is still in very early development. It is inspired by the CMS functionality found in Drupal 6, and aspires to eventually become a flexbile Content Management System in its own right.

The initial goal is to provide the functionality documented in this two-part series where we used Django, resulting in a Rust-powered JSON backend for a single page application:

We are currently building a self-hosted API powered by Actix and Tokio. We also intend to explore building the same self-hosted functionality using Tide and async_std.
